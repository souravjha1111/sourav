      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Sourav! 🌟 If I’m not coding, I’m probably somewhere hiking up a mountain 🏞️, smashing a cricket ball 🏏, or debating with friends on how coffee is the secret to world peace ☕. But here's the real kicker – I’m *absolutely nuts* for startup ideas! 🚀 If you have one, I’m your guy. Let’s brainstorm, strategize, and make it happen. I believe in collaboration and turning big ideas into reality, so hit me up if you're into that too!
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not running marathons 🏃‍♂️ (or trying to at least), you’ll find me working on making my software solutions sleek, efficient, and ready for the next big challenge. I’ve had the privilege of working with <strong>5 amazing startups</strong> so far, building innovative tech solutions and learning from the best in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m well-versed in Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and frameworks like Django, Next.js, Flask, and Selenium. But here’s the kicker – I’m also into low-level design (LLD), so while I love to build big, I also obsess over making things efficient and lean with minimal memory usage. <strong>Efficiency is my middle name</strong> (not literally, but you get it). 🔧
      </p>
      <p>
        So, whether it's building a web app, solving complex problems, or just chatting about the future of tech and startups – I’m always up for something exciting. Let's connect, collaborate, and make some magic happen. 🪄
