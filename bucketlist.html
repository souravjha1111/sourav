      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Sourav! üåü If I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably somewhere hiking up a mountain üèûÔ∏è, smashing a cricket ball üèè, or debating with friends on how coffee is the secret to world peace ‚òï. But here's the real kicker ‚Äì I‚Äôm *absolutely nuts* for startup ideas! üöÄ If you have one, I‚Äôm your guy. Let‚Äôs brainstorm, strategize, and make it happen. I believe in collaboration and turning big ideas into reality, so hit me up if you're into that too!
      </p>
      <p>
        When I‚Äôm not running marathons üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (or trying to at least), you‚Äôll find me working on making my software solutions sleek, efficient, and ready for the next big challenge. I‚Äôve had the privilege of working with <strong>5 amazing startups</strong> so far, building innovative tech solutions and learning from the best in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm well-versed in Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and frameworks like Django, Next.js, Flask, and Selenium. But here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äì I‚Äôm also into low-level design (LLD), so while I love to build big, I also obsess over making things efficient and lean with minimal memory usage. <strong>Efficiency is my middle name</strong> (not literally, but you get it). üîß
      </p>
      <p>
        So, whether it's building a web app, solving complex problems, or just chatting about the future of tech and startups ‚Äì I‚Äôm always up for something exciting. Let's connect, collaborate, and make some magic happen. ü™Ñ
